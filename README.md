# SelectionSort
CS concepts showing the implimtaion of SelectionSort in javascript.

The Selection sort algorithm divides the input list into two parts: the sublist of items already sorted and the sublist of items remaining to be sorted that occupy the rest of the list. Initially, the sorted sublist is empty and the unsorted sublist is the entire input list. 

The algorithm proceeds by finding the smallest element in the unsorted sublist, exchanging it with the next smalles element in the unsorted element.
 
The BigO for a selection sort is `O(n^2)`
